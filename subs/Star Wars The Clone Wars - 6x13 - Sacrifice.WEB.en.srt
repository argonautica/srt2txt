187
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,374
Take 'em!

188
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,418
[blasters firing]

189
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,005
[shouting]

190
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,561
We meet at last,
Darth Sidious.

191
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:59,065
You cannot stop
what is to come.

192
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,195
[yells]

193
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,118
Skywalker, no!

194
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,059
[lightsabers clashing]

195
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,843
No!

196
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,264
[strangled groaning]

197
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,267
[electricity zapping]

198
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,269
[yelling]

199
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,211
[laughing]

200
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,547
[metal creaking]

201
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,517
Save him, Jedi?

202
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,435
Can you save him?

203
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,396
[electricity zapping]

204
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,951
Why not let him go?

205
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,828
Let him die,

206
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,123
and you can stop
all that I will do.

207
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,960
[electricity zapping]

208
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,461
No!

209
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,965
The future is not yours yet.

210
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,467
Tempted I will not be.

211
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,471
Sacrifice all
I am ready to do.

212
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,516
[Darth Sidius laughing]

213
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,148
[metal crunching]

214
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,820
[growls]

215
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,463
[laughing]

216
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:43,456
We have failed to break
Master Yoda.

217
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,792
He is strong.

218
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,168
We will need more time

219
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,839
if we are to defeat him
and the Jedi.

220
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,386
Yoda...

221
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,682
Come back to us, Yoda.

222
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,936
Died have I?

223
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,981
In a way.

224
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,944
Now does my training begin?

225
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,738
The one you know
as Qui-Gon Jinn

226
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,741
will commune with you
and guide your training.

227
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,036
Like us, you shall learn
to maintain your consciousness

228
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,537
after death.

229
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,542
Enlightenment,
spirit,

230
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,210
balance...

231
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,379
There is another

232
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,756
Skywalker...

233
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,215
(Yoda)
There is another...

234
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,383
[baby crying]

235
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,593
Skywalker?

236
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,554
[crying fades]

237
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,856
[R2-D2 beeping]

238
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,526
Yes, time to go home
it is.

239
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,393
The Council has assembled.

240
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,479
They are eager
to hear your report.

241
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,525
Afraid not much there is
to say of my journey.

242
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,947
So nothing significant
happened to you out there?

243
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,115
Yes...

244
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,491
And no.

245
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,785
To the end
we are coming now.

246
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,787
Did your journey
give you insight

247
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,123
on how to win the war?

248
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,416
No longer certain

249
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,128
that one ever does win a war
I am.

250
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,130
For in fighting the battles,

251
00:20:56,172 --> 00:21:00,259
the bloodshed already lost
we have.

252
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,097
Yet, open to us,
a path remains

253
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,766
that unknown to the Sith is.

254
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,937
Through this path,
victory we may yet find.

255
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,814
Not victory
in the Clone Wars

256
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,317
but victory for all time.

257
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,708
